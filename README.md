# Golang Pokedex

Pokedex webapp using Golang and the following packages:

- `github.com/gofiber/fiber` for routing and handling requests

- `github.com/joho/godotenv` for environment variables to store data

- and more to come...



Feature List that I'm aiming for:

[ ] Display Pokemon information from PokeAPI

[ ] Let a user make a (local and temp) profile

[ ] Optionally let users register and make a login that's stored on a server

[ ] Users can search and save Pokemon that they like

[ ] Users can choose nickname, level, gender, nature, ability, IVs, EVs, and moves for their favourite pokemon.
