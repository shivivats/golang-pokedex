# Golang Pokedex

Pokedex webapp using Golang and the following packages:

- `github.com/gofiber/fiber` for routing and handling requests

- `github.com/joho/godotenv` for environment variables to store data

- and more to come...



Feature List that I'm aiming for:

[ ] Display Pokemon information from PokeAPI

[ ] Let a user make a (local and temp) profile

[ ] Optionally let users register and make a login that's stored on a server

[ ] Users can search and save Pokemon that they like

[ ] Users can choose nickname, level, gender, nature, ability, IVs, EVs, and moves for their favourite pokemon. 


Slightly more granular TO-DO List:

[ ] Typography- pick suitable fonts and font sizes for everything

[ ] Colours - make everything look pretty

[ ] Layout - space and lay everything out nicely

[ ] Implement a user login page

[ ] Show the logged in user's name on the party header.

[ ] Change Pokemon sprite or model based on the gen clicked on the preview

[ ] First Page where the user can search up pokemon and add them to their party

[ ] Second page where the user can look at a party pokemon and edit it in detail

[ ] Show pokemon info in the info tabs.

[ ] Display a proper alert message when the user already has 6 pokemon in their party and tries to add another one

[ ] Make the cards in the search results appear above everything
